Fix non collapsing of Alice bases with subclasses and generators and fix alice matrix
Fix Alice key
Improve loops with generators and iterators
System check?? with id at first
sizeof in buffers bytes
choose between random and quantum random and between pycrypto and generic crypto (#FINAL)
encrypt blocks by addr or change Matrix class (leak of data)
add time to the chat and pretty things
security mecanism against resending AliceM matrix. This can be done avoiding dumps of pickle.
Avoid saving Alice matrix (probably impossible)
try with generators and iterators
Use a med flag in Alice class to avoid further measure (no more than twice) and to avoid Keys
Use different sockets in Eva client
Use ForLoop Encrypt with pickle
Have an option tu use a normal password and then convert it to blocks
send message and matrix in un pickle package
research how to create a malicious server that copycats another
option of calibration with serial bus
improve self.bases fix
Perhaps raise exception in str
